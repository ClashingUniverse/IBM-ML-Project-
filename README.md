# IBM-ML-Project-
This is a ML based project for prediction on the fault-types in the electrical systems . This project was made using IBM Cloud under supervision of Edunet Foundations. 
Hello , i am srinivas , i have made a project based on Machine Learning ( ML ), the ML model is totally powered by the IBM Cloud, Watsonx.ai, Watson.ai studio, Cloud Storage Object.
This project is totally dependent on ML , it uses ML to predict the fault-types of the systems or lines at any given point of time.
This project uses dataset provided by Kaggle to train the ML model.
This project uses Random Forest Classifier to predict.
Kindly refer to the ppt or pdf for more information on the Project !
