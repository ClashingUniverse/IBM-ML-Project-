# ⚡ Power System Fault Detection and Classification using Machine Learning

## 🔎 Introduction

In modern electrical grids, detecting and classifying power system faults accurately is critical to ensure reliable and uninterrupted electricity supply. This project, **Power System Fault Detection and Classification using Machine Learning**, aims to automate fault identification in power distribution systems using advanced machine learning techniques.

By leveraging **IBM Watsonx.ai**, scalable cloud infrastructure, and real-time electrical data, this system distinguishes between normal and fault conditions (like line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults) — enabling faster, smarter grid maintenance and improved stability.

## ❗ Problem Statement

In complex power distribution networks, detecting faults manually is time-consuming and prone to error. Operators need a system that can:

* Automatically detect and classify various fault types,
* Use real-time data (voltage, current, etc.),
* Respond quickly to prevent blackouts,
* Reduce downtime, improve reliability, and maintain grid safety.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

This project introduces a **machine learning-based fault classification system** that:

* Uses a dataset from **Kaggle** containing electrical measurement data.
* Trains ML models like **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **Logistic Regression** to detect and classify faults.
* Deploys the model using **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio** and **IBM Cloud Object Storage** for real-time predictions.
* Evaluates model performance using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
